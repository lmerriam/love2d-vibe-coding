### **ACTIVE CONTEXT: "SHATTERED EXPANSE"**

---

### **CURRENT WORK FOCUS**
- Completed major code refactoring for improved AI maintainability
- Creating a modular codebase with clear separation of concerns
- Implementing centralized configuration management
- Improving documentation for easier development

---

### **RECENT CHANGES**
- Restructured the entire codebase into a modular architecture:
  - Created `/src/core/game_manager.lua` for centralized game state management
  - Created `/src/config/game_config.lua` for consolidated configuration values
  - Created `/src/input/input_handler.lua` to handle user input separately
  - Created `/src/rendering/renderer.lua` for all drawing operations
  - Enhanced `/src/world/world_generation.lua` with better procedural generation
  - Improved `/src/systems/ability_system.lua` with clearer structure
  - Enhanced `/src/systems/contract_system.lua` with better organization
  - Streamlined main.lua to focus only on LÃ–VE2D callback coordination
- Added comprehensive development documentation in `/documentation/ai_development_guide.md`
- Created a proper Perlin noise implementation in `lib/perlin.lua`

### **PREVIOUS DEVELOPMENT**
- Implemented save/load system with serpent serialization
- Added persistent meta-progression saving
- Created save/load handlers for game state
- Updated contract system with scroll discovery
- Added contract UI display and progress tracking
- Implemented contract reward distribution
- Added relic system with 4 reconstructible artifacts
- Implemented exploration-focused ability progression system
- Updated contract rewards to include relic fragments and abilities
- Integrated ability effects into gameplay mechanics
- Enhanced death handling to preserve ability progression

### **NEXT STEPS**
1. **Test refactored architecture**:
   - Verify all game functionality works properly
   - Ensure seamless integration between modules
   - Check for any regression issues

2. **UI Improvements**:
   - Implement the Relic Reconstruction UI
   - Enhance ability system visuals
   - Improve progression feedback

3. **Content Enhancements**:
   - Add more biome types and environmental effects
   - Expand the contract system with additional quest types
   - Add more landmark varieties and special discoveries

---

### **ACTIVE DECISIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS**
- Using a global GameState table in GameManager for centralized state management
- Centralizing configuration in game_config.lua to avoid magic numbers
- Using module pattern for clear separation of concerns
- Maintaining explicit module dependencies for better code navigation
- Providing extensive documentation for AI comprehension
- Keeping consistent formatting and naming conventions
- Separating run-specific state from persistent meta-state
- Using observer pattern for contract events

---

### **IMPORTANT PATTERNS AND PREFERENCES**
- Keep Lua modules focused and single-responsibility
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add comments for complex algorithms
- Follow Love2D callback structure (load, update, draw)
- Centralize constants in config file
- Structure code logically by domain (rendering, input, game systems)
- Precompute values where possible for performance
- Document module interfaces clearly

---

### **LEARNINGS AND PROJECT INSIGHTS**
- Modular architecture significantly improves maintainability
- Centralized configuration makes tweaking game parameters much easier
- Clear separation of concerns helps with debugging and feature development
- Comprehensive documentation enables faster onboarding for AI assistants
- Save/load implementation is crucial for roguelite progression
- Contract system provides clear player direction
- Scroll discovery mechanic encourages exploration
- UI space is limited - need to design compact information displays
- Reward distribution needs balancing
- Contract progress tracking impacts performance - needs optimization
