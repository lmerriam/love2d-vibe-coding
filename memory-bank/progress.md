# Progress Tracking

## What Works

- **Core Game Loop**
  - Player movement around the procedurally generated world
  - Exploration and discovery mechanics
  - Hazard interactions based on biome types
  - Contract system for quests/goals
  - Save/load system for meta-progression

- **Architectural Improvements**
  - Modular codebase with clear separation of concerns
  - Centralized configuration in game_config.lua
  - Well-documented code structure
  - Input handling isolated in dedicated module
  - Rendering logic separated from game logic

- **Technical Systems**
  - Procedural world generation using Perlin noise
  - Contract generation and completion tracking
  - Ability system with passive and active abilities
  - Notification system for player feedback
  - Centralized game state management
  - **Relic System**:
    - Relic definition and fragment tracking in `GameState`.
    - UI for displaying relic reconstruction status and fragment requirements.
    - Player ability to attempt relic reconstruction by spending fragments.
    - Debug tools for adding fragments and auto-reconstructing relics.
    - Robust save/load and death persistence for relic fragments and status.

## What's Left to Build

1. **Relic System Enhancements**
   - Define and implement actual in-game effects or abilities granted by each reconstructed relic.
   - Thoroughly test all aspects of the relic system (collection, UI, reconstruction, persistence, effects).

2. **UI Improvements (General)**
   - Better visual indicators for abilities
   - Enhanced contract display
   - More informative player status screen

2. **Gameplay Features**
   - More biome types with unique characteristics
   - Additional landmark types with special interactions
   - More ability types and progression paths
   - Victory condition and end-game sequence

3. **Visual and Audio Enhancements**
   - Improved tile graphics for different biomes
   - Sound effects for actions and discoveries
   - Background music for different areas
   - Visual effects for ability activations

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Limit rendering to visible area
   - Optimize contract progress checking
   - Cache procedural generation results
   - Reduce memory usage for large worlds

## Current Status

The refactoring effort has significantly improved the codebase organization and maintainability. The game is now structured in a way that makes it much easier for AI coding agents to comprehend and extend.

**Recent Developments (Post-Refactor):**
- **Relic Reconstruction System**: A major feature, the Relic Reconstruction UI and its underlying mechanics (fragment collection, spending, status tracking, persistence) have been implemented. This includes:
    - UI display for relics and fragments.
    - Player input (`r` key) to attempt reconstruction.
    - Debug keys (F1 for fragments, F2 for instant reconstruction).
    - Fixes to ensure correct data handling during save/load and player death, preventing issues like fragment doubling or loss of relic definitions.
- Key modules like `GameManager`, `Renderer`, `InputHandler`, and `GameConfig` were updated to support this system.

The core functionality remains intact and has been extended with the relic system. The next steps involve thoroughly testing this new system and then defining the actual gameplay benefits of reconstructing relics.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Approach
- Monolithic design with all code in main.lua
- Hardcoded constants throughout the codebase
- Limited documentation

### Current Approach
- Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Centralized configuration management
- Comprehensive documentation and developer guide
- Well-defined interfaces between modules

### Reasoning
The shift to a modular architecture was motivated by the need to make the codebase more maintainable and comprehensible for AI coding agents. By separating concerns and documenting the structure clearly, we've made it much easier for developers (both human and AI) to understand the code, make changes, and add new features without introducing bugs or inconsistencies.

The centralized configuration approach makes it easier to tweak game parameters without having to search through the codebase for hardcoded values. This will be particularly valuable during the balancing phase of development.

The documentation improvements, including the comprehensive AI development guide, will significantly reduce the learning curve for new developers and make it easier to onboard AI assistants to the project.
