# Progress Tracking

## What Works

- **Core Game Loop**
  - Player movement around the procedurally generated world
  - Exploration and discovery mechanics
  - Hazard interactions based on biome types
  - Contract system for quests/goals
  - Save/load system for meta-progression

- **Architectural Improvements**
  - Modular codebase with clear separation of concerns
  - Centralized configuration in game_config.lua
  - Well-documented code structure
  - Input handling isolated in dedicated module
  - Rendering logic separated from game logic

- **Technical Systems**
  - Procedural world generation using Perlin noise
  - Contract generation and completion tracking
  - Ability system with passive and active abilities
  - Notification system for player feedback
  - Centralized game state management

## What's Left to Build

1. **UI Improvements**
   - Relic reconstruction interface
   - Better visual indicators for abilities
   - Enhanced contract display
   - More informative player status screen

2. **Gameplay Features**
   - More biome types with unique characteristics
   - Additional landmark types with special interactions
   - More ability types and progression paths
   - Victory condition and end-game sequence

3. **Visual and Audio Enhancements**
   - Improved tile graphics for different biomes
   - Sound effects for actions and discoveries
   - Background music for different areas
   - Visual effects for ability activations

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Limit rendering to visible area
   - Optimize contract progress checking
   - Cache procedural generation results
   - Reduce memory usage for large worlds

## Current Status

The refactoring effort has significantly improved the codebase organization and maintainability. The game is now structured in a way that makes it much easier for AI coding agents to comprehend and extend. Key improvements include:

- Created a clear module structure with well-defined responsibilities
- Centralized configuration parameters for easier tweaking
- Added comprehensive documentation in code and separate guide
- Improved the rendering system with specialized rendering functions
- Enhanced the world generation with a more robust Perlin noise implementation

The core functionality remains intact, but is now more maintainable and extensible. The next steps are to test the refactored codebase thoroughly to ensure no regressions have been introduced, then proceed with implementing the remaining features.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Approach
- Monolithic design with all code in main.lua
- Hardcoded constants throughout the codebase
- Limited documentation

### Current Approach
- Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Centralized configuration management
- Comprehensive documentation and developer guide
- Well-defined interfaces between modules

### Reasoning
The shift to a modular architecture was motivated by the need to make the codebase more maintainable and comprehensible for AI coding agents. By separating concerns and documenting the structure clearly, we've made it much easier for developers (both human and AI) to understand the code, make changes, and add new features without introducing bugs or inconsistencies.

The centralized configuration approach makes it easier to tweak game parameters without having to search through the codebase for hardcoded values. This will be particularly valuable during the balancing phase of development.

The documentation improvements, including the comprehensive AI development guide, will significantly reduce the learning curve for new developers and make it easier to onboard AI assistants to the project.
