## Future Gameplay Enhancements: World Navigation

This section outlines brainstormed ideas to make world navigation more interesting and structured.

**I. Restructuring World Layout & Biome Distribution**
    *   **Defined Regions/Continents:** Generate larger, distinct landmasses or regions with thematic biome collections.
    *   **Natural Chokepoints & Pathways:** Design world generation to create natural chokepoints (mountain passes, narrow isthmuses) guiding player movement.
    *   **Tiered Biome Progression & "Hub" Zones:** Structure the world so higher-risk/reward biomes are further from the start or soft-gated. Introduce hub biomes or landmarks.

**II. Implementing Navigational Obstacles & Gating Mechanisms**
    *   **Environmental Barriers:** Introduce initially impassable/costly terrain (e.g., dense thickets, deep rivers, sheer cliffs) requiring tools/abilities.
    *   **Severe Hazard Zones:** Design sub-regions with extreme stamina drain or effects, requiring specific countermeasures.
    *   **Ability/Item Gating:** Make areas inaccessible without specific abilities (Glide, Swim, Climb) or consumable items.
    *   **Knowledge Gating:** Require finding map fragments or clues to reveal safe paths or bypass obstacles.
    *   **Dynamic World Events (Advanced):** Temporary events altering paths (sandstorms, floods, magical barriers).

**III. Enhancing Landmark Significance for Navigation**
    *   **Landmarks as Keys/Activators:** Interactive landmarks that trigger world changes (raise bridges, dispel barriers).
    *   **Landmarks Providing Navigational Tools/Info:** Landmarks granting temporary boons (wider map reveal, pointing to hidden locations).
    *   **Chains of Landmarks:** Mini-quests involving sequences of landmarks leading to rewards or new areas.

**IV. Leveraging Existing Mechanics for Structured Navigation**
    *   **Contracts for Guided Progression:** Design contracts requiring navigation through or overcoming new obstacles.
    *   **Relics Granting Navigational Advantages:** Reconstructed Relics offering powerful navigational abilities (teleportation, hazard immunity, revealing hidden paths).
    *   **Stamina as a Strategic Resource for Traversal:** Severe hazard zones requiring careful stamina management, planning, or specific items/abilities.

- **Progression paths**: Complete but engagement levels require testing
- **Challenge balance**: Present but difficulty curve needs fine-tuning
- **Player motivation**: Systems exist but psychological engagement needs optimization

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Approach
- Monolithic design with all code in main.lua
- Hardcoded constants throughout the codebase
- Limited documentation

### Current Approach
- Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Centralized configuration management
- Comprehensive documentation and developer guide
- Well-defined interfaces between modules

### Reasoning
The shift to a modular architecture was motivated by the need to make the codebase more maintainable and comprehensible for AI coding agents. By separating concerns and documenting the structure clearly, we've made it much easier for developers (both human and AI) to understand the code, make changes, and add new features without introducing bugs or inconsistencies.

The centralized configuration approach makes it easier to tweak game parameters without having to search through the codebase for hardcoded values. This will be particularly valuable during the balancing phase of development.

The documentation improvements, including the comprehensive AI development guide, will significantly reduce the learning curve for new developers and make it easier to onboard AI assistants to the project.
