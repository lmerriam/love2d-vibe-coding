### **PROGRESS: "SHATTERED EXPANSE"**

---

### **CURRENT STATUS**
- Project documentation complete
- Initial project setup complete
- World generation implemented
- Player movement implemented
- Hazard system implemented
- Basic UI implemented
- Meta-progression implemented
- Contract system implemented
- Save/load system implemented

---

### **WHAT WORKS**
- Memory bank documentation system
- Project structure planning
- Biome generation with Perlin noise
- Player movement with arrow keys
- Biome-specific hazard effects
- Player death handling
- Meta-progression saving and loading
- Landmark discovery
- Inventory system
- UI for position, stamina, inventory, and meta resources
- Contract system (generation, tracking, rewards)
- Save/load functionality with serpent serialization

---

### **WHAT'S LEFT TO BUILD**
1. **Core Systems**:
   - Enhanced rendering (landmarks, fog of war)

2. **Supporting Systems**:
   - Audio system
   - Resource management

3. **Content**:
   - Landmark visual assets
   - Ability unlocks

---

### **KNOWN ISSUES**
- Hazard probabilities may need balancing
- Inventory lacks capacity limits
- Landmarks not visually represented
- Contract UI needs polish
